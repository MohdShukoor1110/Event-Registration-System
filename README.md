# Event Registration System

This is a simple command-line application built in Python for managing events and their participants. It allows a user to create events, register participants, view a list of events, and generate a list of participants for a specific event.

## Features.

- Create Event: You can create a new event by providing its name, date, location, and capacity.
- Register Participant: Participants can register for an existing event by providing their name and email, as long as the event has not reached its capacity.
- List Events: Displays all available events along with their current number of registrations and total capacity.
- Generate Participant List: Provides a list of all participants registered for a specific event.

## How to Run
1. Save the Code: Save the Python code you provided into a file named "event_management.py".

2. Run from Terminal: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the following command:
```bash
  python event_management.py
```

## Usage.
When you run the script, a menu will be displayed with five options. Enter the number corresponding to the action you want to perform and press Enter.
